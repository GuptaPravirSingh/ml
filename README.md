### A deep neural network for MNIST image recognition with the following key features:

supports unlimited number of layers, nodes and weights (only restriction is memory)
supports fully connected and convolutional layers
supports following activation functions: SIGMOID, TANH, RELU
light weight architecture with a very small memory footprint
__super fast!__ :-)
